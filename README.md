# ML-Projects:

1) HousingPriceRegression.py file contains the project based on linear regression. The dataset comprises values of aspects (a total of 79 aspects) related to residential places and the price of a house. The goal is to predict the price of the houses for the testing dataset.
Techniques:
Data preprocessing, mainly to handle invalid/missing values and categorical columns.
Training on XG Bosst Regressor machine learning model.  
Mean Absolute error metric used for validation of the model.

3) TitanicClassification.py file contains the project based on binary classification. The dataset comprises the values of data related to passengers like name, age, gender, socio-economic status, etc., and a binary value of whether the passenger survived or not. The goal is to predict the survival of a passenger for the testing dataset.
Techniques Used:
Data preprocessing, mainly to handle invalid/missing values and categorical columns.
Creative Feature Engineering.
Data Visualization.
Training on Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier machine learning models.
Cross Validation metric for validation of the model.
